                        <h4> Matchmaking</h4>
                        <p> Matchmaking is the essence of good educational consulting, and we are skilled at it. We take
                            the
                            time to really listen to clients and their families, to perceive the nuances of each unique
                            situation. Our expertise, diligent research, and over two decades of experience allow us to
                            match you, and your family, to the resources and people that fit best.</p>

                        <h4> Integrative Recovery</h4>
                        <p>Every program we recommend will have the right services, curriculum, and therapeutic
                            modalities
                            to help, as well as appropriately trained staff and strong safety protocols. However, we
                            have a
                            preference for programs that also take care to nurture and support the spirit and soul of
                            our
                            clients. We look for an integrative and functional approach to recovery that seeks to heal
                            the
                            whole person.</p>

                        <h4> Whole Family Healing</h4>
                        <p>We believe in whole family approach to healing. When we recommend a school to your family, we
                            are
                            referring your entire family to the school. One family member is not sent away in the hope
                            that
                            they will come home “fixed,” instead, every member family will be included in the process.

                        <h4>Advocating for You</h4>
                        <p> We are your advocate throughout the entire process of using a school or program. Programs
                            are
                            familiar with us and we are familiar with the programs, their teachers, and their
                            therapists.
                            Because of this relationship, our families often get better service and we are better able
                            to
                            help guide you to a positive outcome. With our help, you will get the full value of the
                            program
                            and any support services offered.</p>

                        <p>We start the process with an intake interview that helps us get a full picture of you and
                            your
                            situation. We gather a thorough history, evaluate any relevant school records and testing
                            data,
                            and conduct interviews with selected individuals (teachers, counselors, coaches). After
                            gathering information and determining the optimal type of environment for you, we will
                            provide a
                            list of possible programs or schools. This phase is about getting you to a wise and informed
                            decision, and we will do what it takes to help you make that decision.</p>
